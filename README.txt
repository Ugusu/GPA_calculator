GPA calculator.xlsx - Excel table, where you can write your credits and grades and get necesarry data.

index.html - The same calculator, but web-based. Might improve in future.

The link for the web-based calculator: https://ugusu.github.io/GPA_calculator/
If the page is not correctly loaded, when trying to download, try this: https://asoiutranscript.netlify.app/

IMPORTANT: Before Exporting, press Calculate, to save data.

Additionally, the project isn't optimized, so if you reload the page, you will lose all inputs and will have to fill them again.
However, the Export function will work anyway, untill you close the browser.
